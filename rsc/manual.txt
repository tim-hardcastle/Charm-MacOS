edit

'hub edit' followed by a filename will open the file in vim.

***
halt

'hub halt' followed by the name of a service will halt the service.

If no service name is given, the hub will halt the current service.

***
help

'hub help' followed by the name of a topic will supply you with information on that topic."

'hub help' on its own will get you a list of help topics.

***
list

'hub list' will list all services currently running on the hub.

***
peek

'hub peek on' will allow you to see what the lexer, relexer, and parser are doing; 'hub peek off' turns this off, and 'hub peek' without a parameter toggles between on and off.

***
reset

'hub reset' followed by the name of a service will re-intialize the script and reread the associated data file, if there is one. If no service name is given the hub will reset the current service.

***
run

'hub run' without parameters will start a REPL with no script. With one parameter (a valid filename) it will run the script as an anonymous service. By adding 'as <name>' you can name the service; by adding 'with <filename>' you can specify a datafile.

***
quit

'hub quit' will close down all the services and the hub.

***
why

'hub why <error number>' will provide a more detailed explanation of an error.

***
where

'hub where <error number>' will show the line in which the error occurred with the specific problem area of the line highlighted and underlined.

***
snap

The 'hub snap' command allows you to record your interactions with the REPL for testing purposes

The syntax is either 'hub snap <filename>' or 'hub snap <filename> with <data filename>' or 'hub snap <filename> with <data filename> as <test filename>'. If no test file name is given Charm will supply a suitable one, and if no data file is supplied Charm will just initialize the service as usual.

Charm will then turn serialization on, so that you can tell the difference between "true" and 'true'; and between four spaces and a tab, etc.

And then what you type and the service’s responses will be recorded. (There will be a '#snap →' prompt to remind you that this is what you’re doing.) To finish recording, you tell it what to do with the snap:

* 'hub snap good': this is the desired behavior and I want to make it into a test that will ensure it keeps happening
* 'hub snap bad' : this is undesirable behavior and I want to make it into a test that checks that it doesn’t happen
* 'hub snap record' : I want to be able to replay this and see how the output changes as I change the script and/or data
* 'hub snap discard' : I don’t need this

All the tests classed good or bad associated with a script will be run by 'hub test <script filename>'. As an example, try running 'hub test src/testall.ch': Charm will run the associated test in the 'tst' folder and hopefully confirm that the interpreter hasn’t regressed since I wrote this bit of the manual.

To run a test classed as record, use 'hub replay <test filename>'.

***
replay

'hub replay <test filename>' allows you to replay a previously recorded snapshot of your interactions with the REPL to see what it does. For more information on this feature, see 'hub help snap'.

***
test

'hub test <filename>' will run all the regression tests associated with the file. For more information on this feature, see 'hub help snap'.

***
continuations

Charm expects the end of a line to coincide with the end of an expression, i.e. you can't write something like this:

|-----------------------------------------------

foo = "hello " + 
"world"

bar = 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6

|-

Continuations must be marked by a '..' at the end of the continued line and a corresponding '..' at the beginning. The allowed exception is that the continued line may end in a comma where this is syntactic, in which case the continuation must begin with '..' just the same. The continuations can be placed wherever is most readable: they are exempt from whitespace rules.

For example, the following are valid assignments:

|-----------------------------------------------

foo = "hello " + ..
   .. "world"

bar = 1, 2, 3,
   .. 4, 5, 6

|-

***
overloading

It is possible to overload functions in Charm: the following code works as you'd expect it to:

|-----------------------------------------------

def

twice(x string) : x + x

twice(x int) : 2 * x

twice(b bool) :
    b : "That's as true as things get!"
    else : "That's as false as things get!"

twice(x any) :
    "Can't double " + string (type x) + "."

|-

In deciding which version of a function to use, Charm will look at the types of the parameters it's passed. When a value could be accepted by more than one version of a function, Charm will use the version with the most specific type signature. So in the example above, both the second version of the function and the fourth could equally well accept an integer, but Charm will always use the second version because 'int' is a subtype of 'any'.

In the unlikely event that you defined functions in such a way that this can't always be resolved, for example like this:

|-----------------------------------------------
def

integersFirst(i int, a any) : i, a

integersFirst(a any, i int) : i, a

|-

... then Charm will throw an error when it tries to initialize the script. (The problem being, if you passed two integers to 'integersFirst' then Charm wouldn't be able to resolve which version of the function to use.

Most things in Charm can be overloaded, including the arithmetic operators, This, for example, works:

|-----------------------------------------------

def

(i int) * (b bool) :
    b : i
    else : 0

|-

However, 'and', 'or', 'not', '==' and '!=' can't be overloaded, and really, why would you want to.

This sort of ad-hoc polymorphism can lead to bad code and should be used with caution, under circumstances where you really need the degree of abstraction that it supplies.

***
functions

Functions in Charm are defined in the 'def' section. Here is an example of a simple function:

|-----------------------------------------------

def

foo(x) :
    x + x

|-

This does what you would think it does: returns twice what is passed to it. (Or throws a runtime error if addition is not defined on the type of the parameter.)

In a function where the body is a single line, it is permitted to write it in one line with the definition:

|-----------------------------------------------

def

foo(x) : x + x

|-

As functions are stateless, the only thing they can do is return a value or values, and so the only reason you would want a function to have multiple lines is to make your conditionals more readable, as in the following example:

|-----------------------------------------------

def

sign(n) :
    n > 0 : "positive"
    n == 0 : "zero"
    else : "negative"

|-

Typing of a function's parameters is optional. If you we replace the earlier example with this:

|-----------------------------------------------

def

foo(x int) :
    x + x

|-

... then 'foo' will be defined for integers but will now throw an error if you try to pass it a float or a string.

Functions can be overloaded. For a full discussion of this topic, see 'hub help overloading'.

Functions can have multiple return values:

|-----------------------------------------------

def

swap(x, y) : x, y

|-

The parameters of functions need parentheses in their declarations, but they are optional when calling the function: i.e. 'foo 1' and 'swap "oyster", 32' are valid function calls.

Parentheses can still be required to disambiguate precedence. 'foo x + y' would be interpreted as 'foo(x + y)', and if you want it to be interpreted as 'foo(x) + y' then you can either write that, or '(foo x) + y'.

Functions can have very flexible syntax:

|-----------------------------------------------

def

(x) divides (y) :
    y % x == 0

(x) is even:
    2 divides x

say (x) nicely :
    "*~*" + x + "*~*"

|-

Typing of a function's return values has not yet been implemented.

***
constants

Constants are defined the same way as variables, only in the 'def' section of the script, making them unchangeable. E.g:

|-----------------------------------------------

def

pi = 3.141592
monthsInAYear = 12

|-

***
comments

Comments begin with '//' and are simply ignored by Charm when it tries to make sense of your program, e.g. if you write

|-----------------------------------------------

// This is a comment.

def   // Another comment.

foo = "walrus"

// Woo-hoo! Comments!

|-

then to Charm this will read the same as if you'd just written


|-----------------------------------------------

def

foo = "walrus"

|-

***
headwords

Charm's headwords are 'import', 'var', 'def', and 'cmd'. What makes them “headwords” is that after one occurs it has scope until another headword (or the end of the script) without needing any braces or parentheses or indentation to establish this.

A headword my occur more than once in the script, with the exception of 'import', which, if it occurs, must do so only once, at the top.

Your script must (with the exception of comments) begin with some headword, since without one Charm doesn't know what you want to do with the code.

For further information, see the help files on the individual headwords, e.g. 'hub help import'.

***
import

The import section consists of filepaths expressed as string constants and separated by newlines:

|-----------------------------------------------

import

"lib/owl_moistening_tools.ch"
"lib/walrus_utils.ch"

|-

Namespaces have not yet been implemented.

***
cmd

The 'cmd' section of the script consists of commands that can be issued by the end-user, and which can change and return the state of the variables, including those declared private. For example:

|-----------------------------------------------

cmd

get :
    return x

set (y) :
    x = y

var

private

x = "heffalump"

|-

***
var

In the 'var' section of the script you can declare variables. Their type is inferred as narrowly as possible unless you explicitly declare them of wider type. E.g in the following code ...

|-----------------------------------------------

var

foo = "bananas"

zort single = "bananas"

troz any = "bananas"

|-

... it will then be possible to reassign 'foo' only to other strings, to 'zort' anything that isn't a tuple, and to 'troz' anything at all.

After the occurrence of 'private' in a 'var' block, the variables will be private, i.e. they can be changed or accessed only by commands defined in the 'cmd' section, but not directly through the REPL. For more information see 'hub help private' and 'hub help cmd'.

***
def

The 'def' section is where you define structs, constants, and functions. For more information, see the relevant help files for each topic, e.g. 'hub help structs'.

***
structs

Struct types are declared in the 'def' section of the script using the using the form 'nameOfStruct = struct(<type signature of constructor>)'.

|-----------------------------------------------

person = struct(name string, age int)

cat = struct(name string, pink bool)

|-

Then instances of the structs can be created in the 'def' or 'var' sections of the script using the constructors ...

|-----------------------------------------------

joe = person("Joe", 42)

myCat = struct("Rose", true)

|-

Or there are also long-form constructors for when clarity is needed:

|-----------------------------------------------

joe = person having name :: "Joe", age :: 42

myCat = cat having name :: "Rose", pink :: true

|-

Struct objects are indexed using square brackets: 'myCat[pink]' or 'joe[name]'.

The names of the fields are first-class objects of type 'label'.

***
private

When a variable is private, it can only be accessed via getters and setters supplied in the 'cmd' section of the script.

The 'private' modifier makes everything after it private until the next headword or the end of the script. There is no corresponding public modifier: things are public first by default, and private after you say so. Using 'private' twice without a change of headwords is a syntax error.

At present, 'private' only affects variables, and cannot be used to hide functions, constants, commands, etc from direct access via the REPL.
